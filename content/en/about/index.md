### Practical Experience  
As a district public health nurse in a government ordinance–designated city, I worked across maternal and child health, adult health, older adults, intractable diseases, and school health—covering everything from individual case support to community health education.
  
In maternal and child health, I was responsible for Prenatal Classes; “Pre‑Baby Plaza”, which shares knowledge and skills with parents before the 4‑month infant checkup; the “Mothers Requiring Support” group aimed at reducing parenting anxiety; and the “Parent–Child Class for Infants and Toddlers (‘Toddler Class’)”, a venue for follow‑up observation and group instruction for children with developmental challenges and their caregivers—overseeing operations as well as evaluation and improvement.
  
In adult health, I led Specific Health Guidance and a Public–Private Collaboration Network Project, partnering with healthcare, welfare, education, and industry to build resident‑led initiatives, support lifestyle improvements, and conduct health promotion activities.
  
I also provided back‑office support for voluntary groups, including a Multiples Families Association (for families with twins/triplets), the Health Promotion Volunteer Group / Kita Ward Health Promotion Committee, and a Mental Health Peer Group.
  
### Teaching Experience  
Courses taught: Foundations of Public Health Nursing; Public Health Nursing Diagnosis & Program Development; Advanced Public Health Nursing; Community & Home Nursing Assistance; Integrated Nursing Practicum; Medical Sociology, etc.
  
In practicums on and off campus, I collaborate with local governments and community organizations, valuing mutual learning within the community. I continuously work to improve course design and practicum management. Building on my experience as a TA, I provide attentive out‑of‑class learning support and research advising (introductions to qualitative research and how to read the literature).
